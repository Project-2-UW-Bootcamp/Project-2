# **DOGSTR**
## Dog Park Playdate App

This application allows users from all over to search for nearby dog parks in their area using our built in google maps API. Users can filter their search by the park's distance, rating, or the overall popularity of the location. Users can also connect with other dog owners with ease, and schedule their next pup playdate with people from around the gl obe.
